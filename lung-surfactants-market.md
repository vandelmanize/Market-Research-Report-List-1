<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lung Surfactants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intratracheal</li><li>Injectable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lung surfactants market is categorized into two main types: intratracheal and injectable surfactants. Intratracheal surfactants are administered directly into the trachea to enhance lung function, primarily in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. Injectable surfactants, on the other hand, involve delivering the surfactant through intravenous or other injectable routes, catering to a broader range of patients, including adults with various pulmonary conditions. Both types aim to reduce surface tension in the lungs, improving gas exchange and overall respiratory health.</p></p>
