<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Shoulder Replacements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Prostheses</li><li>Uncemented Prostheses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial shoulder replacements market features two primary types: cemented and uncemented prostheses. Cemented prostheses utilize bone cement to secure the implant, providing immediate stability and strength, making them suitable for patients with weaker bone quality. In contrast, uncemented prostheses are designed for biological fixation, allowing bone to grow into the implant surface over time, which is ideal for younger, more active patients with healthier bone quality. Both options cater to different patient needs and surgical preferences.</p></p>
