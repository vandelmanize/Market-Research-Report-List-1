<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fibre Veil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Netting Process</li><li>Dry Netting Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glass fibre veil market is primarily categorized into two types based on production processes: the wet netting process and the dry netting process. The wet netting process involves applying a resin to glass fibers to create a bonded, flexible material that's often used in applications requiring high moisture resistance. In contrast, the dry netting process utilizes dry glass fibers that are integrated without the use of resin until later in manufacturing, resulting in lighter, versatile products suitable for diverse applications.</p></p>
